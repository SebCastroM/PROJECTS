###[ATM](https://sebcastrom.github.io/PROJECTS/JS/ATM/)
>It was done to work as a ATM, it shows how much money is available to dispatch (editable from class.js), you can writte the amount you want to have and after clicking the RETIRAR button* the page will show you the bills of your transaction and the current balance after the withdraw, you can do this untill the balance is $0.
</br>-class.js, on this file you can edit how many bills have the ATM it modifies automatically the balance.
```javascript
let caja = [];  //(denomination, total)
caja.push(new Billete(100, 5));
caja.push(new Billete(50, 6));
caja.push(new Billete(20, 7));
caja.push(new Billete(10, 6));
````
</br>The withdraw doesn´t work if you writte an amount that ends with a value minor than 10, ex -21-5-315- cause the denomination of the bills is -100-50-20-10-
